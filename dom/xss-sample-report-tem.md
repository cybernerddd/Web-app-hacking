# Sample Report Template: DOM XSS Edition

### 1. Title
DOM-Based XSS via `location.hash` in profile.html

### 2. Summary
A DOM-based XSS vulnerability exists in `profile.html` due to unsafe usage of
 `location.hash` being directly assigned to `innerHTML`. This allows an attacker
 to inject arbitrary JavaScript and execute it in the victim's browser.

### 3. Steps to Reproduce
`Navigate to`:
```js
https://target.com/profile.html#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```
Observe that an alert is triggered due to execution of injected JavaScript via onerror.

### 4. Vulnerable Code
```js
const user = location.hash.substring(1);
document.getElementById("welcome").innerHTML = user;
```
Here, the attacker controls location.hash, which is directly injected into the DOM using innerHTML without sanitization.

### 5. Payload
```js
#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

Encoded:
#%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E
```
### 6.   Impact
JavaScript can be executed in the victimâ€™s browser
Can be used to steal session cookies, deface pages, redirect users, or perform CSRF
High impact in applications handling sensitive data (e.g., admin panels, banking, etc.)

### 7. Recommended Fix
Avoid using innerHTML with unsanitized user input
Use textContent instead, or sanitize input using a library like DOMPurify:
```js
document.getElementById("welcome").textContent = user;
```
### 8. Proof of Concept (PoC)
(Include a screenshot of the alert box or a video if you're submitting a bounty)
```js
https://target.com/profile.html#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```
