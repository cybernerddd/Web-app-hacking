## Conditional Statements
### `If Statement`
```javascript
The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block,
 or block statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}
if (true) {
console.log('This is if statement');
}
//prints "Tjis is if statement"

Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.
- If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
- If the condition evaluates to false, the block wonâ€™t execute.

```
